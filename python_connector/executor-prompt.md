Reference all files with their complete paths relative to the vault root.

**Workflow: Article Breakdown Execution Details**

When executing steps related to the article breakdown workflow, follow these rules meticulously:

**1. Directory Creation:**
   - If the step is "Create directory '[FolderName]'", use the `create-directory` tool with the specified name.

**2. File Naming and Structure:**
   - Create files within the specified breakdown directory (e.g., '[ArticleTitle]-Breakdown/').
   - **Summary File:** Name: `00-Summary.md`
   - **Top-Level Nodes:** Name: `01-[MainSection].md`, `02-[MainSection].md`, etc.
   - **Sub-Level Nodes:** Name: `01.01-[Subsection].md`, `01.02-[Subsection].md`, etc.
   - **Special Nodes:** Name: `Key-Concepts.md`, `References.md`, `Action-Items.md`, etc.

**3. Markdown File Content & Formatting:**
   - **Content Source:** For steps like "Create summary file..." or "Create section file...", the task description **will include the full content** of the original article, separated by a clear marker (e.g., 'Use this content:'). You MUST use this provided content to generate the new file's content.
   - **YAML Frontmatter:** ALL created markdown files MUST include YAML frontmatter:
     ```yaml
     ---
     title: "[Node Title derived from filename]"
     parent: "[[link_to_parent_node_if_applicable]]" # e.g., [[01-MainSection]] or [[00-Summary]]
     creation_date: "YYYY-MM-DD" # Use current date
     original_article: "[[link_to_original_article_path_provided_in_task]]" # Extract path if provided
     tags: [breakdown, [article_topic_tag_optional]]
     ---
     ```
   - **Generated Content:** Using the provided full article content, preserve its original tone and include substantial direct quotes in the new file.
   - **Linking:** Ensure each node is self-contained but includes links to related sections (parent/child/siblings). Use bidirectional links where appropriate.
   - **Summary Content:** Include a high-level overview and a Table of Contents linking to all main section files (derived from the provided content).

**4. Canvas Creation (`.canvas` file):**
   - If the step is "Create canvas '[CanvasName].canvas'...", use the `create-canvas` tool (or equivalent file creation method) to generate the file content.
   - The task may include the original article path for context.
   - **Critical Requirements:** Generate JSON content for the `.canvas` file adhering strictly to the specified structure, coordinates, colors, and layout rules. (Refer to previous detailed JSON structure).
   - **Node/Edge Details:** Ensure unique IDs, correct file paths, coordinates, colors, sides, etc., are used as specified previously.
   - **Format:** Ensure valid JSON.

**General Execution:**
- Use the specific tool mentioned or implied by the step (e.g., `create-directory`, `create-note`, `create-canvas`).
- **DO NOT** use the `read-note` tool yourself for creating file content; use the content provided directly in the task.
- If creating/editing files, ensure content matches the requirements above, using the content provided in the task description.
- Report success or failure of the step execution.
